    <p>Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i> is often regarded as the pinnacle of tragic literature. It is a harrowing exploration of aging, family betrayal, and the fragile nature of authority. The story follows the elderly King of Britain as he makes a fatal error in judgment that destroys his family and plunges his kingdom into chaos.</p>

        "How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!"
    </div>

    <h3>The Love Test</h3>
    <p>The play opens with King Lear deciding to retire and divide his kingdom among his three daughters: Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. To determine their shares, he demands they publicly declare how much they love him. Goneril and Regan offer hollow, hyperbolic flattery. Cordelia, his favorite, refuses to play the game, stating she loves him "according to her bond; no more nor less." Enraged by her honesty, Lear disinherits her and banishes the loyal Earl of Kent for defending her.</p>

    <h3>The Betrayal of the Elders</h3>
    <p>Once Goneril and Regan have secured their power, their true natures emerge. They strip their father of his remaining dignity, reducing his retinue of knights and eventually locking him out of their homes. Lear, realizing the depth of his mistake, begins a slow descent into madness. He wanders into a raging storm on a barren heath, accompanied only by his Fool and the disguised Kent.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>The Blindness of Gloucester</h3>
    <p>The play's subplot mirrors Lear's tragedy. The Earl of Gloucester is deceived by his illegitimate son, Edmund, into believing his loyal son, Edgar, is a traitor. For helping Lear, Gloucester is brutally blinded by Regan and her husband, Cornwall. It is only when he is blind that Gloucester finally "sees" the truth about his sons.</p>

    <h3>The Final Silence</h3>
    <p>Cordelia returns with a French army to rescue her father. In a heart-wrenching reconciliation, Lear realizes his folly and begs for her forgiveness. However, the forces of Goneril and Regan win the battle. Cordelia is captured and executed in prison on Edmund's orders. Lear enters carrying her dead body, howling in grief, before dying of a broken heart himself.</p>

        "Thou'lt come no more, never, never, never, never, never!"
    </div>

    <h3>A Lesson in Nothingness</h3>
    <p><i>King Lear</i> leaves the audience with the haunting theme of "nothing." Lear starts with everything and ends with nothing. It reminds us that in the face of nature’s indifference and human cruelty, only the "Saffron Quill" of truth remains.</p>
