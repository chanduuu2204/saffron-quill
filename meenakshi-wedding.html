    </div>

    <p>In the heart of Madurai, where the air is thick with the scent of jasmine and the sound of ancient bells, lives one of the most beautiful love stories ever told—the Meenakshi Tirukalyanam.</p>

    <h3>The Princess with the Fish-Eyes</h3>
    <p>Born out of a sacrificial fire to King Malayadwaja Pandyan, Meenakshi was no ordinary child. She was an incarnation of Goddess Parvati, born with three breasts and eyes shaped like a fish (<em>Meen-akshi</em>). A prophecy declared that her third breast would disappear the moment she met her future husband.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>The Conquest (Digvijaya)</h3>
    <p>Meenakshi was raised as a warrior queen. She conquered the eight directions, defeating kings and even gods. Finally, she reached Mount Kailash, the abode of Lord Shiva. But as she stood before Him, her fierce warrior spirit melted. Her third breast disappeared, and she realized she had found her Sundareswarar (the Beautiful One).</p>

    <h3>The Grand Wedding</h3>
    <p>The wedding in Madurai was a cosmic event. Lord Vishnu, the brother of Meenakshi, traveled from Srirangam to give her hand in marriage. This celestial union is celebrated every year during the Chithirai Festival, drawing millions of devotees who witness the symbolic wedding of the earth and the heavens.</p>
